        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Good! You've gotten the latency service up and running. This is the landing page of the Latency API Service
            and will describe a few things about it. If you already know about the service go ahead and do your thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Latency API Service provides a comprehensive way of retrieving latencies of various stations or networks
            within the <a href="https://synopticlabs.org/api/mesonet/">Mesonet API</a> using GET requests. This can be used
            to monitor any station(s) or network(s) in near real time to see if there may be an error in the Mesonet API or
            an issue with a station.
        </p>

        <p>To get a glimpse of what the API offers go to this link:
            <a href="localhost:8888/monitor" target="_blank">localhost:8888/monitor</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            This shows everything that the service currently has in memory. The memory gets dumped into log files every
            (15) minutes.
